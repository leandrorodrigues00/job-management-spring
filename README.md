## 👩‍💻 About the project

This project simulates a system for managing companies, job postings, and applications, leveraging key features of Spring Boot, such as persistence, security, and authorization. Authenticated users can explore and apply for job openings posted by partner companies, while companies can register new organizations and job listings on the platform.

The complete documentation of the endpoints was created using Swagger, and security is implemented with JWT, ensuring secure and authenticated access to the system's functionalities.
